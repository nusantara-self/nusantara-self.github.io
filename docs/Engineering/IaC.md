# Infrastructure as Code

- Used for provisioning and managing cloud resources
- Example : Creating and provisioning a VM
- Referring to all APIs used to deploy infrastructure

- Declarative statements : the yaml configuration is a picture of the desired stage. Unlike CLI commands which are imperative and tells what to do : We can focus on how the infrastructure should be.

Popular solution : Hashicorp Terraform, which is multi API / multi-cloud with an open-source core.
