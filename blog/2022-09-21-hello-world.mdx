import ReactPlayer from 'react-player'

My name is **Fabien**, I'm a **27 years old cybersecurity engineer** and.. this is my first blog post on here. :)

Most of my posts here will be **tech-related** and the main goal is to document my **learning** and **exploration journey**.

From time-to-time, some posts might be more *personal*, like *travel* or *music* related; I just hope to **make of that space one that truly defines things I wish to share** and I'm **passionnate about**. Making it as comfortable as I wish it to be. No worries, tagging *might* be used in order to separate those!

A documentation tab will also be present to allow for storing quick tips & tricks on specific subjects : **cloud**, **python**, **automation**, **security operations** and so on.

If some things are useful to me, then they might be to you; welcome to my space.

Enjoy!
